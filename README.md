# ReceiptProgram
# Overview

I wanted to make a program that would teach me out to update and read files and have a program get better as I used it I chose to make a receipt program that would make your shopping easier and easier every time you use 
the program. This would help me budget my shopping it would let me know before I even left my house if I would be 
over or under budget for the week.

# Development Environment

Tool #1: I used a tool named java.io that allows you to read and write to a file.

Tool #2: I used was java.util this tool allows you to take user input that is not just String.

Tool #3: I used intellij this is what I used to code in.



The programing language that I picked to code in for this project is Kotlin. Kotlin is a mix 
between java and python. According to articles that I found this language is used for android device.
It is a fun language to code it but there are more steps than coding in python.

# Future Work


* One thing that I could do to make this program better is format my Doubles so they round to the second decimal place.
* Another thing that I could do to improve this program is when printing the receipt it puts it in md format so you can
send it to a pdf and print it out.
* The last thing that I would do to improve this program is to make it so you can add what ever store you want 
and not just shop at the select few.
